Hello, my name is livia, I come from Sichuan, China, and now I live in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. I like music festivals very much. The last music festival I watched was in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province.
The festival featured hip-hop artists like C-Block, nineone, who I love.
For most people, watching music festivals is very tiring, but for me, it doesn't feel tired, even if I need to run back and forth between several music festival stages, just to get closer to my favorite singers and listen better.
There are many people like me who run to and from multiple stages, so there will be a crowd in front of the stage. I don't like being in the crowd, but when I think of listening to songs far away without being immersed in the feeling, I still choose to be in the crowd.
When listening to music festivals, I really enjoy singing loudly with my friends along with the singers. In that state, people will feel very happy and free, which is what I love and yearn for, so I like listening to live music festivals very muchã€‚
